Assignment 5.1
This assignment is to find the conditions which influence the customer to accept a coupon. There are different coupons from Restaurants, Bars and Take Away offers.

For this analysis I picked the coupons for cheaper Restaurants to see what behavior will influence the customer to accept the coupon.

To Start with I divided the data into two Income groups of < $50K and >$50 to see if the income bracket had any influence on the selecting coupons for cheaper restaurants and found that income does not matter.

Then added the weather condition to see how it might influence the decision and found that customers tend to accept to coupons during Sunny days and added to that prefer the coupons more when they are our for a casual drive/destination rather than on way to Home or work (regular routine)

The coupons being accepted had either a 2 Hr or a 24Hr expiry. The 24Hr expiry window was much preferred cause it gave customers better time to plan restaurant visits while on casual drives. Customers preferred if the coupons are offered during the PM (later half of the day) more then in the mornings, could be weekend drives
